# Delphi-Business

This is a project I've made during a programming academia organized before an internship. It's a Monopoly-like game written fully in Delphi. The code is 100% mine, it was the first project created in Delphi, I've never learned this language before the academy. I worked on it all by myself, the teacher didn't interfere in the code, provided  only a general guidance and allowed us to work on our own. The project was rated highest among all projects done by participants of the academy.After the academy I was offered an internship for a year in that company.
The idea of a game is not original, it is a more or less accurate copy of MONOPOLY, or to be exact, a polish version of Monopoly created somewhere in the 80's, still popular today despite most of the countries shown there are long gone (Benelux, Western Germany etc).
I did not use Git back then as I didn't know how to use it, that's why the entire project is here in one single commit done after the academy. I decided to focus on learning Delphi only back then, as we had a limited time to do the project. I would definitely use Git or other version control system now, as, especially at the end, I struggled between different builds of the game and started to experience some difficulties due to lack of clear organization and the chronology of changes made.
